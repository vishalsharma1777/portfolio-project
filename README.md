<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

I built a portfolio website to showcase my work and skills. I used only html and css. I tried to make it responsive. I used flexbox and grid. I used media queries to make it responsive. I used css variables to make it easy to change the colors. Overall everthing is in root and variable so we can change anything we want.
